### Project Summary
This project visualizes all earthquakes in the past 7 days, courtesy of the United States Geological Survey (USGS). They update their data every 5 minutes, so this visual thus updates accordingly. 

The earthquake visuals are color-coded according to magnitude, and they can also be filtered. Should you wish to only view magnitude 4-5 activity, you may select from a menu at the top. You may also click on each individual point to see the named location of the activity and the magnitude.

In order to better illustrate  the relationship between seismic activity and tectonic plates, the tectonic plates are also visualized. Like the earthquake data, you may click on the plate and see the name of the plate.
